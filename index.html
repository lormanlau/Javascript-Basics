	<h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orented scripting language. JavaScript is extreme popular for a variety of reasons. Its is a sall and lightweight language allowing maxium flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different driectons. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provice programmatic control over them.</p>

		<li>
			<a href="#">Variable Declartion</a> JavaScript variables are containers for string data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffe, the cup holds the coffe, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables just be identifed with unqiue names. These unqiue names are called identifers. <span>var x;</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#"> Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operation assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have offe poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#">Data Tyes</a> Data rtyes are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. These are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditionals statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code block; <span>else</span> if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#">Loops</a> These are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeart an acction some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an excaspulation of code block. When we call our our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions, Sadly there are a ton more tables to do lets call our function over and over and over again.
